Owing to the swift advancement of Ethernet technology and the escalating need for 
intelligent transformation in manufacturing, motion control systems that operate on 
universal Ethernet have emerged as a prominent area of research. These networked systems 
offer several benefits including streamlined wiring, reduced system coupling, 
enhanced scalability, and simplified maintenance. Consequently, they have found extensive 
applications in various sectors such as laser engraving, printing, welding tongs, and textiles. 
However, the introduction of the Ethernet technology into the motion control system brings 
new problems, such as network-induced delay and packet loss. 
To achieve high-precision motion control, methods such as active disturbance rejection control, 
equivalent input disturbance, and intermediate observer are used to estimate and compensate for disturbances in real-time.

The experimental system comprises a rotating machinery test bed, sensors, 
data acquisition cards, signal conditioning modules, and a computer for 
experimental data analysis. By substituting the components of the device 
with damaged parts, we can simulate single-point or composite failures. 
An effective and interpretable approach for managing the health of 
rotating machinery involves integrating physical model constraints into 
data-driven methods, such as physics-informed deep learning and feature extraction.
