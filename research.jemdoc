Position synchronization control (PSC) for multi-axis servo systems is a crucial part in manufacturing industry, which is used to ensure that all machine shafts move synchronously and coordinately according to a certain proportion during the motion. With the rapid development of network communication technologies, both academia and industry have attempted to implement the PSC for networked motion control systems (NMCSs), for example, the computer numerical control (CNC) systems, the surface mount systems, the electric multiple units, and the robotic arms. Although the application of the NMCS brings many benefits, such as simplified wiring, powerful extensibility and easy maintenance, it also raises several new challenging issues. One of them is the network-induced delay, which may seriously degrade system performances. An effective method to address this problem is to consider the time delay as a network disturbance and compensate for it using approaches based on disturbance observers.

Fault diagnosis is an approach designed to comprehend and assess the operational state of mechanical equipment, determining its overall or partial normalcy or abnormality which is employed in the health management of sizable machinery, including wind turbines, ship motors, gas turbines, aviation engines, and cranes. Nevertheless, the progression of intelligent manufacturing has resulted in an escalation of structural complexity and precision in mechanical equipment, introducing challenges such as nonlinearity, non-stationarity, incompleteness, incomplete information, and insufficient fault category coverage in operational monitoring data. Consequently, time and frequency domain feature extraction methods based on wavelet packet decomposition and analysis of cepstrum are used to extract features characterizing prominent faults. Simultaneously, multi-scale analysis methods are applied to capture additional fault-related information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of fault diagnosis.

Power transformer (PT) is one type of transformer used for electrical energy transmission. 
The health of the PT plays an essential role in the reliability and supply sustainability of electricity. Recently, there have been numerous literatures devoted to improving the maintenance and repair capability of PTs from the perspective of the prognostics health management. Among them, unbalanced learning and data security in power transformer fault diagnosis are still open issues. The emergence of federated learning (FL) has provided a secure and distributed learning framework. But, there are still two issues that need to be addressed before using the FL-based fault diagnosis methods. The first issue is the statistical challenge brought by the variability of unbalanced data in data quantity and category distribution. The second issue is the trade-off between model performance and the level of privacy protection. To address such challenges, we have designed data-sharing and privacy-preserving strategies, that is alleviating the impact of imbalanced data on model training by sharing global data and safeguarding private data by injecting Gaussian noise into the uploaded parameters.

Multi-agent systems (MAS) have received increasing attention due to their wide range of applications in areas such as collaboration, formation flying, and vehicle networking. However, the probability of failure has increased greatly due to the expansion of the system scale. The failure of any node may spread its effect to the whole system through the communication network. Therefore, the problem of fault-tolerant control of MAS has increasingly become a research focus. Existing observer-based frameworks have some limitations: 1) Most of the existing observers are designed offline, i.e., the parameters are chosen in advance, which lacks flexibility.2) There is no explicit optimization scheme for online fault estimation. To address these challenges, a new structured distributed intermediate estimator is proposed. In addition, a reinforcement learning estimation strategy is introduced to achieve online dynamic tuning of key parameters, thus improving the real-time estimation performance.
